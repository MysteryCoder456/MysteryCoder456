## About Me
I'm a High School Student. I like making Discord Bots, multiplayer games, web and mobile apps. My main interest is towards game and web dev,
I started coding because I wanted to learn to make cool games and websites.

## Languages üíª
<h3><img src="/logos/python.svg" width=18px /> Python</h3>
<p>
  I started learning Python in 2018 and I still use it to this day. I've made quite a lot of projects with Python,
  but now I just use it for spinning up quick and dirty scripts and utilities.
</p>

<h3><img src="/logos/rust.svg" width=18px style="background: #EA735E;" /> Rust</h3>
<p>I began with Rust in early 2022 and I love it ü¶Ä! Any new project that can be sustainably made with Rust, I make with Rust.</p>

<h3><img src="/logos/swift.svg" width=18px /> Swift</h3>
<p>Got started with Swift and iOS development around the same time as Python. I learnt SwiftUI and made a few apps with it too.</p>

<h3><img src="/logos/flutter.svg" width=18px /> Flutter</h3>
<p>
  I learnt Flutter for a competition and I felt it's quite similar to SwiftUI. It has some things that make life harder,
  but also improved on some aspects from SwiftUI.
</p>

<h3><img src="/logos/godotengine.svg" width=18px /> Godot</h3> 
<p>I absolutely adore this game engine. It's simple, intuitive, and doesn't bloat your system like Unity or Unreal Engine.</p>
