  I'm a High School Student. I like making video games, web/mobile apps, and random utility software in low-level languages every now and then.
  My main interest is towards web and network software development, but I started coding because I wanted to learn to make video games.

  <h2>Languages</h2>
  
  <h3><img src="/logos/python.svg" width=18px /> Python</h3>
  <p>
    I started learning Python in 2018 and I still use it to this day.<br>
    I've made quite a lot of projects with Python, but now I just use<br>
    it for spinning up quick and dirty scripts and utilities.
  </p>
  
  <h3><img src="/logos/rust.svg" width=18px style="background: #EA735E;" /> Rust</h3>
  <p>
    I began with Rust in early 2022 and I love it ðŸ¦€! Any new project<br>
    that can be sustainably made with Rust, I make with Rust.
  </p>
  
  <h3><img src="/logos/swift.svg" width=18px /> Swift</h3>
  <p>
    Got started with Swift and iOS development around the same time<br>
    as Python. I learnt SwiftUI and made a few apps with it too.
  </p>
  
  <h3><img src="/logos/flutter.svg" width=18px /> Flutter</h3>
  <p>
    I learnt Flutter for a competition and I felt it's quite similar to<br>
    SwiftUI. It has some things that make life harder, but also improved<br>
    on some aspects from SwiftUI.
  </p>
  
  <h3><img src="/logos/godotengine.svg" width=18px /> Godot</h3> 
  <p>
    I absolutely adore this game engine. It's simple, intuitive, and<br>
    doesn't bloat your system like Unity or Unreal Engine.
